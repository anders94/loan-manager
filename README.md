loan-manager
============
Loan-manager automates positioning virtual and fiat currency loan offers on exchanges based on configured
strategies. It runs regularly reading active loans, open loan offers and the lendbook for each currency
on each exchange creating and updating loan offers based on the selected and configured strategy.

Supported Exchanges
-------------------
* [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
* [Poloniex](https://www.poloniex.com/)

Setup
-----
*Clone this project:*
```
git clone https://github.com/anders94/loan-manager.git
```

*Install dependancies:*
```
npm install
```

*Generate API Keys*
Generate keys on the exchanges you want managed. When creating Bitfinex keys, make sure "margin funding" 
has "write" capability. Poloniex keys don't require special access grants although an IP access list can be
configured.

Make sure there are funds available in the lending wallets. On Bitfinex, the lending wallet is the "deposit
wallet".

*Set up the configuration file:*
```
cp config/index-example.js config/index.js
```

*Edit `config/index.js`*
Add the keys and secrets to the exchange sections. Modify and add sections as necessary for each exchange / currency you wish to lend. Be sure to
closely follow the example configuration; `loan-manager` doesn't deal well with configuration errors.

Main configuration settings:
* *loopDelayInMinutes:* Time in minutes between each run of the logic
* *msDelayBetweenAPICalls:* Time in milliseconds between API calls. Exchanges usually limit the number of calls 
  that can be made from the same IP / account.

Exchange specific configuration settings:
* *credentials:* key and secret API settings from the exchange - these can also be passed as environment variables
* *active:* this true or false turns loan management on or off for this currency
* *minimumRate:* minimum percentage rate below which `loan-manager` will not create loan offers
* *minimumSizeUSD:* the value in US Dollars of the minimum loan amount. Exchanges have a lower limit on the amount
  of currency that can be offered in a single offer.
* *maximumSizeUSD:* the value in US Dollars of the maximum loan amount. Use this if you want to limit the upper 
  bounds of what the `loan-manager` will offer in a single offer.
* *rateCreationStrategy:* names and configures the strategy to be used when creating loans. Valid names include
  `topOfTheBook` and `percentDepth`.
  * *topOfTheBook:* Positions offers at the same rate as the top offer in the book. No other parameters are necessary.
  * *percentDepth:* Requires `lendbookPositioningPercentage` which describes how deep into the book to position the
    offer. For example, `10` would position the offers at whatever rate is 10% into the book by volume.
* *rateUpdateStrategy:* names and configures the strategy to be used when evaluating open loan offers. Valid names
  include `outOfRange` and `lowerRateWithTime`.
  * *outOfRange:* Requires `driftPercent`. If an offer is more than `driftPercent` above the target rate, cancel the
    offer.
  * *lowerRateWithTime:* Requires `lowerAfterMinutes` and `lowerByPercent`. If an offer is older than `lowerAfterMinutes`,
    lower the offer's rate by `lowerByPercent`. For example, if `lowerByPercent` is set to 10, an offer at 5.85% will
    be lowered by 10% to 5.256%.

Run the application
-------------------
```
node app
```

The application will run in the foreground positioning loans using all available funds in the lending wallets.
After running through each exchange and currency, `loan-manager` will wait the `loopDelayInMinutes` time and
start over again continuously.

FAQ
---
*Q: Because interest is compounded daily, isn't multiplying the daily rate by 365 to get the yearly rate incorrect?*

 A: Yes. More correctly we would raise the daily rate plus one to the 365th power but as you don't ever hold a loan
    for an entire year, we more closely approximate the actual rate by simply multiplying the daily rate by 365.

| Daily Rate | Daily * 365 | ((Daily+1)^365)-1 |
|-----------:|------------:|------------------:|
|      0.01% |       3.65% |             3.72% |
|      0.05% |      18.25% |            20.02% |
|      0.10% |      36.50% |            44.03% |
